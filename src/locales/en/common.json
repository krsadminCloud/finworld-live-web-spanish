      "overview_p1": "The FinWorld Home Affordability Calculator is designed to help you answer one of the most important questions in the homebuying process: \"How much house can I really afford?\" By combining your income, existing monthly debts, down payment, and key mortgage assumptions, the tool estimates a purchase price that fits within common lender guidelines while still giving you a realistic picture of your monthly payment.",
      "overview_p2": "Instead of focusing only on the sticker price of a home, this calculator breaks your payment down into principal and interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and HOA fees. Seeing all of these components together can make it easier to balance your housing goals with other priorities like saving for retirement, paying down debt, or building an emergency fund.",
      "how_to_title": "How to Use This Home Affordability Calculator",
      "how_to_p1": "Start by entering your annual household income and your total monthly debt payments, such as auto loans, student loans, and credit cards. Then choose a target down payment amount and adjust the interest rate, loan term, property tax rate, and insurance estimate to match what you are seeing from lenders and local listings.",
      "how_to_p2": "As you update these inputs, the calculator recomputes your estimated maximum home price and monthly payment, along with a PITI breakdown. You can fine-tune the front-end and back-end DTI ratios to reflect more conservative or more flexible underwriting standards, then use the comparison chart to test different price points or interest rate scenarios before you start touring homes.",
      "examples_title": "Home Affordability Examples",
      "examples_p1": "Consider a household earning $120,000 per year with $500 in monthly non-housing debt. Using a 28% front-end DTI and 36% back-end DTI, the calculator might show that a payment around a certain range is considered comfortable, translating into a target price band for homes in your area depending on rates and taxes.",
      "examples_p2": "In a higher-cost metro with elevated property taxes and HOA fees, the same income and debt profile may support a lower maximum home price. By adjusting the tax and insurance assumptions upward, you'll see how these location-driven costs compress affordability and why two similarly priced homes can produce very different monthly payments.",
      "examples_p3": "Finally, imagine a scenario where your income is stable but you carry significant student loan or auto debt. The calculator will show how higher monthly obligations eat into your debt-to-income capacity, and how paying down certain loans first could expand the price range you can comfortably afford in the future.",
      "mistakes_title": "Common Home Affordability Mistakes",
      "mistakes_p1": "A frequent mistake is anchoring on the maximum amount a lender is willing to approve rather than what fits your day-to-day budget. Just because a loan is technically approved does not mean it will feel comfortable once you layer in childcare, transportation, and other living expenses. This calculator is meant to help you pick a target below your absolute maximum if that aligns better with your financial goals.",
      "mistakes_p2": "Another pitfall is underestimating variable costs like property taxes, insurance, and HOA dues, or assuming they will stay flat over time. These line items can rise, sometimes faster than income. Building in a buffer by using slightly higher estimates can keep your plan resilient if rates or local tax assessments change.",
      "terms_title": "Understanding Key Terms",
      "terms_p1": "Your <strong>front-end DTI</strong> (debt-to-income ratio) looks at housing costs as a percentage of your gross income, while your <strong>back-end DTI</strong> includes housing plus other debts. Many lenders use thresholds such as 28% and 36%, but actual guidelines vary by program and credit profile.",
      "terms_p2": "<strong>PITI</strong> stands for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance and represents your core housing payment. If you live in a community with <strong>HOA fees</strong>, those dues are added on top. A larger <strong>down payment</strong> typically lowers your loan amount and may reduce or eliminate PMI, which helps stretch your budget further.",

      "q2": "What debt-to-income ratios does this tool use?",
      "a2": "By default, the calculator uses common front-end and back-end DTI ratios, such as 28% for housing and 36% for total debt. You can adjust both to see how tighter or looser guidelines change what you can afford.",
      "q3": "Does this include taxes, insurance, and HOA fees?",
      "a3": "Yes. Property taxes, homeowners insurance, and HOA dues are included in the PITI breakdown so your estimated payment aligns more closely with a real mortgage quote.",
      "q4": "How does my down payment affect affordability?",
      "a4": "A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lower your monthly payment and may remove PMI requirements. This calculator lets you experiment with different down payment amounts to see how they change the maximum home price you can afford.",
      "q5": "Can this tool help me stay within safe DTI ranges?",
      "a5": "Yes. By combining your income and monthly debts with lender-style DTI targets, the calculator estimates a home price that fits within common underwriting guidelines so you can avoid overextending your budget.",
      "q6": "What if property taxes or insurance are higher in my area?",
      "a6": "Property tax and insurance costs vary widely by location. You can adjust both values to more closely match local quotes, and the calculator will show how those changes affect your affordable price and total monthly payment."

By combining the core pieces of a mortgage payment—principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, PMI, and HOA fees—this tool gives you a clearer picture of your full monthly housing cost, not just the base loan amount. You can explore different home prices, down payments, loan terms, and interest rates to see how each choice affects affordability and total interest over time.",
      "overview_p2": "Whether you are comparing a 15-year versus 30-year mortgage, deciding how much to put down, or thinking about refinancing, this calculator is built to support side-by-side what-if scenarios. Use it early in your search to set realistic expectations, then revisit it as you receive rate quotes, adjust your budget, or consider alternative properties. The goal is not to replace professional advice, but to give you a structured way to run the numbers and feel more confident in the decisions you bring to your lender or financial advisor.",
      "howto_title": "How to Use This Mortgage Calculator",
      "howto_p1": "Start by entering the estimated home price and your planned down payment. You can switch between entering a dollar amount or a percentage, which makes it easy to test scenarios like \"What if I put 20% down instead of 10%?\" Next, choose a loan term, such as 15 or 30 years, and enter the interest rate you expect based on lender quotes or current market averages.",
      "howto_p2": "After that, refine the estimate by including property taxes, homeowners insurance, and any HOA fees you expect for the property. If your down payment is below 20%, you can add an estimate for PMI to see how it affects your total monthly payment. Once your inputs look right, review the monthly payment breakdown, amortization details, and total interest over the life of the loan. Adjust one input at a time—such as the rate, term, or down payment—to understand which levers make the biggest difference to both affordability today and long-term costs.",
      "examples_title": "Mortgage Calculation Examples",
      "examples_p1": "Imagine a first-time homebuyer purchasing a $400,000 home with 10% down, a 30-year term, and a 6.5% interest rate. After including estimated taxes, insurance, and PMI, the calculator might show a monthly payment that is higher than expected, with a large share going to interest in the early years. This scenario can highlight how long it takes to build equity and how sensitive the payment is to interest rate changes.",
      "examples_p2": "In a second scenario, consider a buyer with a similar budget but able to put 20% down on the same $400,000 home. By removing PMI and reducing the loan amount, the monthly payment drops, and total interest over 30 years decreases significantly. The calculator makes it easy to see how the larger upfront investment can pay off over time.",
      "examples_p3": "Finally, think about a homeowner comparing a refinance from a 30-year mortgage at 6.5% to a new 15-year mortgage at a lower rate. The monthly payment may rise, but the total interest paid over the life of the loan could fall dramatically. By plugging both the current loan and the potential refinance terms into the calculator, you can quickly see whether the trade-off between higher monthly payments and lower long-term costs makes sense for your situation.",
      "mistakes_title": "Common Mortgage Mistakes to Avoid",
      "mistakes_p1": "One of the most common mistakes is focusing only on the principal and interest portion of the payment and ignoring taxes, insurance, PMI, and HOA dues. This can lead to underestimating your true monthly housing cost and stretching your budget too far. Another mistake is basing affordability solely on the maximum amount a lender is willing to approve rather than what comfortably fits into your broader financial plan.",
      "mistakes_p2": "Many borrowers also lock in a rate without comparing multiple lender offers, which can mean paying more in interest over the life of the loan than necessary. Failing to understand how rate buydowns, points, and closing costs affect the break-even point is another frequent oversight. Use this calculator to test different rate scenarios and payment levels before you commit, and revisit your numbers if your income, debts, or savings change during the homebuying process.",
      "terms_title": "Understanding Key Mortgage Terms",
      "terms_p1": "The <strong>interest rate</strong> is the cost you pay to borrow money, expressed as a percentage of the loan balance. The <strong>APR</strong> (annual percentage rate) is a broader measure that can include certain lender fees in addition to the base rate. While this calculator focuses on the rate you enter for payment calculations, it is still helpful to compare APRs when reviewing lender offers.",
      "terms_p2": "<strong>PMI</strong> (private mortgage insurance) is typically required when your down payment is below 20% and is an extra monthly cost on top of your base payment. <strong>Escrow</strong> refers to the account your lender may use to collect and hold property tax and insurance payments, bundling them into your monthly payment. Your <strong>DTI</strong> (debt-to-income ratio) is the percentage of your gross income that goes toward debt payments, including your mortgage. Lenders use DTI to assess how much you can reasonably afford to borrow.",

    "faq": {
      "q1": "How are mortgage payments calculated?",
      "a1": "Mortgage payments are calculated using an amortization formula that considers the loan amount, interest rate, and term. The result is a fixed monthly payment that covers both principal and interest, with the mix shifting over time as you pay down the loan.",
      "q2": "What is PMI and when does it apply?",
      "a2": "PMI usually applies when you put less than 20% down on a conventional mortgage. It protects the lender in case of default and adds an additional monthly cost until you reach a certain equity threshold or refinance.",
      "q3": "What is a good debt-to-income (DTI) ratio for a mortgage?",
      "a3": "Many lenders prefer a total DTI at or below about 43%, though some programs allow higher depending on credit, reserves, and other factors. A lower DTI generally gives you more flexibility and can improve loan approval odds.",
      "q4": "How do extra payments change my mortgage?",
      "a4": "Extra payments reduce your principal faster, which can shorten your loan term and lower total interest. Even small recurring extra payments can make a noticeable difference over 15 or 30 years.",
      "q5": "Is refinancing always a good idea?",
      "a5": "Refinancing can be beneficial if you secure a lower rate or a term that better matches your goals, but it also comes with closing costs and a new timeline. Use this calculator to compare your current payment and payoff schedule with potential refinance options.",
      "q6": "How does a shorter term affect total interest?",
      "a6": "Shorter terms, such as 15-year mortgages, concentrate payments into a smaller window, which increases monthly payments but typically results in much lower total interest paid compared with longer terms like 30 years.",
      "q7": "How do property taxes, insurance, and HOA fees change my payment?",
      "a7": "Property taxes, homeowners insurance, and HOA fees are added on top of your principal and interest to form your total monthly housing payment. The calculator lets you enter estimates for each so you can see a more realistic monthly cost instead of just the base loan payment."
